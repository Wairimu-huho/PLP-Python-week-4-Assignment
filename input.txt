Stop making life harder than it is. Life is difficult enough without you making it worse. 
Trying to be perfect, saying yes when you want to say no, apologizing for things that aren’t your fault—these behaviors not only make your life harder but also diminish your power and confidence.

Successful women know how to set boundaries, say no gracefully, and take responsibility for their own happiness. 
You are in charge of your life. No one else has that responsibility.
